An Anaconda virtual enviroment was used for for the training and running models. To replicate the same enviroment,
follow the instructions below:

1. Open an anaconda command prompt

2. Enter "conda create -n tf tensorflow pip python=3.8" into the command prompt
This creates the enviroment and installs/uses python 3.8

3. Enter "conda activate tf"
This activates the newly created anaconda enviroment

4. Enter "pip show tensorflow" into the command prompt
This will display the current version of tensorflow that is installed

IF the tensorflow version is not 2.4.1 then follow the instructions below:
5. Enter "pip install --upgrade tensorflow==2.4.1"
This will upgrade the tensorflow to the correct version

6. Enter "pip show tensorflow" into the command prompt
Enter this command in the command prompt once again to verify that version 2.4.1 is now installed.

7. Enter "pip install tensorflow-gpu" into the command prompt

8. Enter "conda install -c anaconda protobuf" into the command prompt

9. Enter "cd fyp\models\research" and then "protoc object_detection\protos\*.proto --python_out=." into the command prompt

10. Close the current anaconda command prompt then open a new one and activate the enviroment again with "conda activate tf"

11. Enter "pip install cython" into the command prompt

12. Enter "pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI" into the command prompt

NOTE: Visual C++ 2015 build tools are a requirement and have to be installed otherwise errors may arise.

13. Change directories to the research folder (fyp\models\research) and enter "copy object_detection\packages\tf2\setup.py ."

14. Enter "python -m pip install ." into the command prompt

15. Enter "pip install imutils" into the command prompt

This project was made using Tensorflow 2.4.1 and Python 3.8
