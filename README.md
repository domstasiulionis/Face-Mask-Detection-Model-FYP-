# Face_Mask_Detection-FYP-

Final year project (FYP) for the degree of BEng Software Engineering at the University of Greenwich. The aim of this project was to create an accurate face mask detection model
using convolutional neural networks and machine learning. The goal of the project was to ensure that the final model was able to detect whether a person was or was not wearing a
face mask in real-time via webcam stream. Overall, 9 iterations of were made using two methods. The first method involved using the Tensorflow object detection API and the second 
was a transfer learning method using Keras. The best models produced by both methods are uploaded to this repository alongside the dissertation, which documents the entire development process of this project and the models. However, the tensorflow object API method had been the main focus during developement whereas the transfer learning with Keras was implementedto mainly serve as a comparison of other exisitng methods to investigate whether it would yield better results.

Languages and libraries used: Python 3.8, TensorFlow 2.4, Keras
